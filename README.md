# ServerScanner
Based off of Masscan, and modified by Footsiefat.

### Advantages
* Faster than Copenheimer
* Made to be efficient, and no API calls.
^^ It only pings the minecraft server and writes it to the Database.

### Caveats
* Writes to Sqlite Database synchronously, both are bad.

Contributing makes a difference, thanks in advance.
